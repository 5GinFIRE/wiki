# 1st 5GinFIRE Open Call FAQs

* **Is there any Available documentation?**

Please have a look at Deliverables at https://5ginfire.eu/deliverables/ and at this wiki http://wiki.5ginfire.eu

* **How is the experiment lifecycle working? Will the experimenter be allowed to access directly the OSM launchpad/APIs, or the only interaction allowed is via the 5GinFIRE portal?**

Please check the wiki http://wiki.5ginfire.eu/#the-5-gin-fire-architecture-technologies-services-and-testbeds. Normally the access will be only through the portal. Still access to OSM launchpad is something to be examined

* **Considering that we would like to instantiate multiple slices, are we allowed to execute them in parallel?**

This depends on resources, but normally you should be able to do that

* **Is there a multi-site federated infrastructure, or the different testbeds are seen as individual sites? In the last case, where should be specified the site for deployment?**

5GinFIRE has available interconnected multiple VIMs under OSM. Any site or multi-sites can be selected for deployment 

* **Is inter-VNF communication based on classical virtual networking like in OpenStack?**


* **Is OpenStack the VIM/NFVI used in the sites? Which version specifically? **



* **Are we allowed to upload specific images on the VIM/NFVI while implementing VNFs? **


* **Will the experimenter get access (i.e. SSH) to the deployed instances? If yes, how? Via VPN or public IPs?** 


* **In case of VPN, are there some firewall rules?**


* **Will you accept proposals with potential modifications to the OSM tool? If yes, which version should be considered, TWO or THREE? **


* **Will you accept proposals with potential modifications/extensions to the 5GinFIRE portal? **


* **How are those extensions supposed to be integrated? Should we consider potential modifications to the components, or should we only use APIs (hopefully with SDKs you may provide)?** 


* **In case of extensions based on APIs, are you providing an API description which we could consider for our initial solution design? Please let us know also about any restrictions due to any RBAC mechanism you utilise.** 


* **Currently we have only noticed that the experiment lifecycle mainly deals with category 1 types of experiment, therefore it is not clear how those potential extensions could be realised and be deployed on demand on top of your platform.**
