# Description of the VNF

ICARUS experiment is executed on the PPDR ONE testbed utilizing data from qMON network sensors acting as IoT data emulators and having as mentor Mr Luka Koršič  on behalf of PPDR ONE facility.

ICARUS plans to combine the agility of a virtual Deep Packet Inspection (vDPI) function with the flexibility of data protocol mapping functions (e.g. CoAP, MQTT, HTTP to generic UDP), allowing to the overlay IoT services to be automatically deployed and programmed by a single domain coordinator/orchestrator/experimenter. 

Our main objective of the proposed SDN/NFV-enabled IoT ICARUS experiment is to expand the interoperability level of the 5GINFIRE/PPDR ONE by providing an agile manner for data interoperability.
