<!-- SUBTITLE: Software Defined Radio Slices with HyDRA Experiment -->

# Overview
WINS_5G, the reconfigurable radio testbed at Trinity College Dublin, provides virtualized radio hardware, software virtualisation, Cloud-RAN, Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), and Software Defined Networking technologies to support the experimental investigation of the interplay between 5G radio and future networks. This 5GINFIRE testbed adds the capability to instantiate network function virtualisation (NFV) experimental vertical instances (EVIs) to the radio access network supported by the radio slicing and virtualisation layer called Hypervisor for Software Defined Radios (HyDRA), developed by Trinity College Dublin researchers. This experiment, which can be carried out using the WINS_5G infrastructure supported by deployed HyDRA As A Service (HyDRA-AAS) Network Service Descriptor (NSD) and Virtual Network Function Descriptor (VNFD), will describe the process of deploying and experimenting with 5G radio slices. The HyDRA-AAS NSD and VNFD used in this experiment are available from the 5GINFIRE Market place. WINS_5G is ideally equipped to investigate the combination of network slicing, virtualisation functions, and physical layer approaches into coexisting and coherent next-generation commercial networks, including, but not limited to, 5G.
