# PPDR ONE Experiment example
## Experiment Overview

The example scenario utilizes qMON Monitoring solution implemented as VxFs and NSD to enable client-server network performance measurements between different VIM hosts or VIM providers.

## qMON Monitoring Solution

qMON Intervention Monitoring solution is a telco-grade 5G-ready measurement automation system for mobile, fixed and cloud environments (TRL9). It provides:
* Probes, management backend and analytics tools
* Live network and service tests/troubleshooting 
* Real-time performance and SLS/SLA monitoring
* Drive and benchmark testing for broadband PPDR networks (LTE/4G and 5G)
* PPDR network coverage and mission critical application performance assessment
* QoE/QoS prediction in live BB PPDR networks

**Figure 2: qMON System Architecture**

The qMON system comprises 4 main parts based either on cloud VMs, containers or dedicated consumer and industrial HW:
* **qMON NetworkSensor** – Autonomous distributed agent for emulating user (mobile/fixed) activities and active services/applications
* **qMON Manage** – cloud-based back-end agent management
* **qMON Collector**– centralized data and KPI collection infrastructure;
* **qMON Insight** – Advanced KPI analysis and visualizations using professional real-time and offline BI analytics tools (Kibana, Grafana and Tableau).
