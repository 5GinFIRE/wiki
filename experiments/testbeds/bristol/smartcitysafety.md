# Smart City Safety
Given the critical importance of security in cities, innovations in the technology are increasingly improving the safety of city inhabitants. New services such as automated detection of suspicious activities allows a quicker response to threats. 5G and Network Function Virtualization enable solutions that help protect city inhabitants in different environments. Video surveillance is an example that combined with artificial intelligence (or machine learning), will help to lower crime rates and to improve life conditions and improve peopleâ€™s safety. This demo presents a smart city safety system where the combination of Mobile edge Computing (MEC), Network Function Virtualization (VNF) and Machine Learning technologies enable identify suspicious activities in the city. As a blueprint demonstration face detection, face recognition and video transcoder are deployed as virtual functions reducing response delay. In addition, a virtual function that enables speech recognition has been deployed to detect suspicious conversations.
