# Description of the QoE VNF
In the experiment for the QoE assessment, we have used a special tool with No-Reference QoE algorithms. No-Reference (NR) metrics evaluate the quality of digital images without access to non-distorted reference images or any features representing the reference images. Instead of making comparisons, No-Reference techniques try to identify or predict impairments such as blockiness or jerkiness by analysing the characteristics of the underlying network transport and/or by analysing the video itself. The advantage of NR models is their applicability on the client side. Moreover, this technique can be used in real-time. Most of the existing NR models are of the distortion-specific kind and assume that the assessed image is afflicted by a particular kind of distortion. Other approaches use natural scene statistics or employ learning-based classification methods.
The QoE tool can be used as a separate processing module that can provide QoE metrics to video streams provided over the network. We have created a separate QoE tool VNF and added it to the 5GinFIRE catalogue, enabling other experimenters to gather QoE data of videos in real-time. The QoE tool VNF can be run on MEC nodes and can receive video using various streaming protocols (RTP, RTSP, â€¦). The QoE tool VNF performs real-time video analysis and writes the results to a log file. The QoE tool has the possibility to be run with a user interface however for the VNF version we have prepared it in the headless mode.
