# 5GinFIRE Portal User Guide

Welcome to the 5GinFIRE Portal User Guide.
5GinFIRE offered services and tools target to accommodate the following envisaged user roles. All users are assumed to be Authenticated:
* Experimenter: This role represents the user that will utilize our services and tools to deploy an experiment. That is the experiment description in terms of e.g.: NSD (Network Service Descriptor) or TOSCA Specification (in future versions)
* VxF developer: This role is responsible to upload  VNF and NSD Descriptors in the 5GinFIRE services
* Testbed provider: This role represents users that are responsible for testbed administration, configuration, integration, adaptation, support, etc
* Services administrator: This role represents the user that are responsible for maintenance of the 5GinFIRE services

Finally an anonymous user role exists who has some really simple usage scenarios (e.g. signup through the portal)
