# The 5GinFIRE MANO platform
The 5GinFIRE MANO platform is the system that enables the management and orchestration of network services (NS), potentially composed of multiple VxFs, across the NFV experimental infrastructures provided by 5GinFIRE partners. To fulfill this objective, the platform offers a northbound interface to the 5GinFIRE portal, enabling the operations that are needed to support the execution of experiments (e.g., onboarding a NS and a VxF). A simplified overview of the 5GinFIRE MANO platform is depicted in the figure below.
