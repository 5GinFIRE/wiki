# 5GinFIRE Testbeds
## 5TONIC
The global 5G Telefonica Open Innovation Laboratory (5TONIC) has been established in Madrid (Spain) as a leading European hub for knowledge sharing and industry collaboration in the area of 5G technologies. The laboratory provides an open research and innovation ecosystem for industry and academia that will promote joint project development, joint entrepreneurial ventures, discussion fora, and a site for events and conferences, all in an international environment of the highest impact. 5TONIC will also serve to evaluate and demonstrate the capabilities and interoperation of pre-commercial 5G equipment, services and applications. Currently, the 5TONIC laboratory has ten members: Telefonica, Institute IMDEA Networks, Ericsson, Intel, Commscope, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Cohere Technologies, InterDigital, Altran and RedHat.

## IT-AV AUTOMOTIVE TESTBED

The vehicular network which serves the base automotive use case consists of On-Board Units (OBUs) in the vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) connected to the Internet through an Ethernet interface. The vehicles connect among each other via standard IEEE 802.11p/ WAVE links, and are connected to the RSUs and the Internet through IEEE 802.11p/ WAVE, IEEE 802.11g/ WiFi or cellular links.

## Bristol Smart City Safety Testbed
Given the critical importance of security in cities, innovations advances in wireless communication system are increasingly improving the safety of city inhabitants. New services such as audio and video monitoring of public areas and automated municipality rule infraction detection allow a quicker response to threats and anomalies prevent reoccurrence. Based on this context UNIVBRIS has deploying a smart city safety use case, as a proof of concept, to identify suspicious activities in the city. The basic components of this use case are listed below and they are connected together to the Internet through a WiFi Interface.

## eHealth Testbed
eHealth5G facility (located in Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center, Poznan, Poland) is a new testbed created thanks to accepted 5GinFIRE open call infrastructure project and will be available for experimenters from December 2018. eHealth5G facility extends the current 5GinFIRE architecture with a new eHealth Experimental Vertical Instance (eHealth EVI) providing 5GinFIRE experimenters with the possibility of performing experiments in the area of eHealth and telemedicine in a remotely accessible testbed designed for testing technical and usability aspects of services running on top of 5G NFV infrastructure composed of small Edge Cloud, being very closed to eHealth devices, and Core Cloud accessible via MPLS/Optical Service Provider network. The eHealth Vertical Industry infrastructure located in PSNC consists of cutting-edge eHealth equipment enabling eHealth cloud applications, products or services implementation and testing for hospitals, clinics, medical universities, medical or sports professionals.

## NITOS testbed
NITOS is a highly heterogeneous testbed, located in the premises of University of Thessaly in Volos, Greece. The facility is an addition to the 5GInFIRE testbed offering, accepted as a 1st Open Call infrastructure project. Through the integration of the NITOS testbed, 5GinFIRE users will have the opportunity to take advantage of several highly programmable cutting-edge resources for wireless networking (such as mmWave, SDR, LTE networks and WiFi), bundled with Software Defined Networking and Cloud Computing resources. The incorporation of this new equipment will allow the evaluation of several vertical applications for 5G over the 5GinFIRE infrastructure, including cloud based Virtual/Augmented Reality applications, wireless eHealth critical applications, wireless home entertainment, and Smart City experimentation.
