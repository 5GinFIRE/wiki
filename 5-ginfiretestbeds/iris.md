<!-- SUBTITLE: 5G radio and future networks experimentation platform -->

Iris - the reconfigurable radio testbed at Trinity College Dublin provides virtualized radio hardware, software virtualisation, Cloud-RAN, Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), and Software Defined Networking technologies to support the experimental investigation of the interplay between 5G radio and future networks. Our facility pairs underlying flexible radio and computations resources with various hypervisors in the form of software radio frameworks, virtualized network functions (VNFs), and network slicing capabilities to realize various research and testing configurations. These platforms are connected to a private computational cloud, allowing us to deploy an array of computational environments. To expose the functionality of these platforms for a variety of applications, we employ a variety of radio hypervisors that freely enable prototyping of wireless systems, as exemplified by GNURadio. These radio hypervisors combined with dynamic distributed network functions supported by virtual machines and containers, enable the realization of heterogeneous radio platforms that can support malleable and adaptable networks. Iris is ideally equipped to investigate the combination of network and radio slicing, virtualisation functions, and physical layer approaches into coexisting and coherent next-generation commercial networks, including, but not limited to, 5G.
# 5G Testbed Architecture 
A high-level overview of Iris testbed architecture is depicted in Fig. 1. The functional elements layer, at the bottom, represent the tangible resources including servers, switches, USRPs, and so forth, at the Iris testbed. The virtualisation layers in the middle are supported by virtualisation technologies including OpenStack to support cloud computing, OpenFlow to slice the network, and HyDRA to virtualise the radio. The experiments resource layer at the top, supported by the Open Source Network Function Virtualization (NFV) Management and Orchestration (MANO) (OSM) software stack in the virtualisation layers, interacts with the physical and virtualisation layers to instantiate experimental vertical instances (EVIs). These technologies interact with the FUTEBOL EU project Container Orchestration and Provisioning Architecture (COPA) virtual machine instances  to support monitoring NFV functions in wireless, packet and optical networks, Ubuntu Containers (LXC), and GNU Radio images, exposing the functionality of physical resources to applications and across different 5G verticals.

Logically, the Iris testbed can be thought of as consisting of five functional layers, as illustrated in Fig. 1. These include:
* Functional Elements: The bottom layer represents the physical resources, such as servers, switches, N210 USRPs, etc. These elements are sliced by the hypervisor layer.
* Virtualisation Layer: To expose the functionality of physical equipment for applications, Iris employs a variety of hypervisor tools and technologies. This layer provides support for open source cloud virtualisation technologies (OpenStack), SDN techniques (OpenFlow, and Open vSwitch), and Software-Defined Radio (SDR) elements (GNU Radio with HyDRA).
* NFV Layer: OSM supports the deployment of EVIs across the Virtualisation and Functional Layer elements, by supporting the creation of virtual machine instances and instantiation of communication between virtual machines in physical rack servers. These elements provide a fully functional orchestrator for EVIs at Iris.
* Virtualised Experiments: The next layer correspond to the virtualised testbed resources, allocated to the experimenter for a specific period of time.
* Experiments / 5G Application: This layer sits at the top and is defined and controlled by the experimenter. It is the EVI environment that supports a 5G end-to-end application that can fully utilise the virtualised resources offered by the lower layers. 

# HyDRA
The open source HyDRA hypervisor licensed under the GPLv3 and developed by Trinity College Dublin researchers [1], provides USRPs virtualisation capabilities, enabling them to support multiple 5G verticals simultaneously. HyDRA, as shown in Fig. 2, abstracts the RF front-end by adding a layer of indirection between EVIs, i.e., the radio used by each EVI. Virtual RF front-ends (vRF front-ends) operate as if they were interfacing directly with a standard SDR RF front-end by sending/receiving digitized IQ samples. HyDRA ensures isolation while allowing each EVI to adopt its own PHY and MAC technology, and configure its central frequency, bandwidth, and sampling rate on-the-fly.

The internal architecture of HyDRA is shown in Fig. 3. HyDRA makes use of a spectrum map to keep track of these configurations. The spectrum map is flexible in HyDRA. For example, vRF front-ends can request any central frequency or bandwidth, as long as bands of operation of different vRF front-ends do not overlap. Usually, these configurations are set during the bootstrap of HyDRA, but our architecture allows for computational inexpensive on-the-fly changes, as they only trigger an update in the IQ mapping.

The multiplexing process based on FFT/IFFT operations is a perfect fit for our virtualization objectives. First, FFT/IFFT operations are low-level baseband processing operations agnostic of the access technology implemented at the higher layers of the vRF front-end; this enables any EVI to be mapped to a vRF front-end, independently of the access technology it implements. Second, modifications in the original signal caused by the multiplexing are not distinguishable from well-known wireless disturbances, e.g., path-loss, frequency shift, and phase distortion; this allows receiving devices to recover the data transmitted using conventional physical layer equalization mechanisms. Finally, the FFT/IFFT are computationally efficient operations, highly optimized for modern processors through Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD); this allows HyDRA to multiplex several vRF front-ends simultaneously while using only a fraction of the resources of modern processors.
# Experimentation Equipment

Iris - the reconfigurable radio testbed at Trinity College Dublin, pairs underlying flexible radio and computations resources (Functional Elements layer in Fig. 1) with various hypervisors (virtualisation layer) to realize several research and testing configurations. The following radio and hardware resources have been allocated 5GINFIRE project at Iris. These include: 
* 4 x wall-fixed and ceiling mounted USRP N210s equipped with SBX daughterboards supporting frequencies between 400 MHz and 4.4 GHz. 
* 8 SMA Direct Connect Wi-Fi 2.4GHZ/5GHZ Antennas; 
* 1 GB Ethernet Connection to N210 USRPs. 
* 2 x Dell PowerEdge R620 servers
* 8 Ports on a Dell Networking S4048T-ON SDN switch, supported by ONOS.



# Overview of EVIs enabled for 5GINFIRE
These projects and packages will support the instantiation of many different EVI for enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), and massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC), and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) across the Iris radio testbed. We briefly describe these EVIs and the opportunities enabled by 5GINFIRE in the next subsections.

## eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC requirements
eMBB must support stable connections with very high peak data rates, as well as moderate rates for cell-edge users. Indeed, eMBB communication is characterized by large payloads and by a device activation pattern that remains stable over an extended time interval. The objective of the eMBB service is to maximize the data rate, while guaranteeing a moderate reliability, with packet error rate (PER) on the order of 10-3 [3].
mMTC must support a massive number of IoT devices, which are only sporadically active and send small data payloads. mMTC devices are active intermittently and use a fixed, typically low, transmission rate in the uplink. At a given time, data traffic arrives only to an unknown (random) subset of the huge set of mMTC devices connected to a given base station [2].

URLLC must support low-latency transmissions of small payloads with very high reliability from a limited set of terminals, which are active according to patterns typically specified by outside events, such as alarms. URLLC transmissions are also intermittent, but the set of potential URLLC transmitters is much smaller than the set of potential mMTC transmitters. The rate of a URLLC transmission is relatively low, and the main requirement is ensuring a high reliability level, with a PER typically lower than 10âˆ’5[2].

Iris will provide examples of radios for eMBB, mMTC, and  URLLC that can be used by Open Call experimenters. However, although these examples are fully capable of performing communication between nodes, it is not capable of coping with the stringent requirements of very high data peak rates for eMBB, the massive number of devices for mMTC, or latencies under 1 ms for URLLC. The next section  gives an overview of the capabilities of each radio technology that will be provided Iris.

## Enabling eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC at the Iris Testbed
Iris provides the HyDRA radio virtualization layer to enable the vastly different requirements of eMBB, mMTC and URLCC EVIs. More precisely, HyDRA enables the creation of multiple independent virtual RF front-ends on top of a single physical RF front-end. Virtual RF front-ends can then be assigned to a EVI. Radio resources can be assigned to each virtual RF-front by using the RRMF (presented above). For example, a large channel bandwidth must be used by the base station to achieve the very high peak data rates required by eMBB; thus, the vRF front-end assigned to the eMBB slice can use the set_bandwidth RRMF to increase the bandwidth used. The large channel bandwidth in combination with tailored radio access technology for the baseband processing can enable advanced eMBB experiments at the Iris testbed.
