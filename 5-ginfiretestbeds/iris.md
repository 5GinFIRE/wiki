<!-- SUBTITLE: 5G radio and future networks experimentation platform -->

Iris - the reconfigurable radio testbed at Trinity College Dublin provides virtualized radio hardware, software virtualisation, Cloud-RAN, Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), and Software Defined Networking technologies to support the experimental investigation of the interplay between 5G radio and future networks. Our facility pairs underlying flexible radio and computations resources with various hypervisors in the form of software radio frameworks, virtualized network functions (VNFs), and network slicing capabilities to realize various research and testing configurations. We employ a Dell Networking S4048T-ON high performance SDN/OpenFlow 1.3 enabled switch connected to underlying radio resources including 18 USRP N210s, 2 USRP X310s, 2 USRP N210 Beam forming ceiling mounted nodes, all equipped with SBX daugtherboards, reaching frequencies between 40 MHz and 4 GHz. These platforms are connected to a private computational cloud, allowing us to deploy an array of computational environments. To expose the functionality of these platforms for a variety of applications, we employ a variety of radio hypervisors that freely enable prototyping of wireless systems, as exemplified by GNURadio, srsLTE 3GPP, and the Iris SDR. These radio hypervisors combined with dynamic distributed network functions supported by LXC, LXD and Docker containers, enable the realization of heterogeneous radio platforms that can support malleable and adaptable networks. Iris is ideally equipped to investigate the combination of network slicing, virtualisation functions, and physical layer approaches into coexisting and coherent next-generation commercial networks, including, but not limited to, 5G.
