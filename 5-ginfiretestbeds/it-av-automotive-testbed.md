# Testbed Introduction

## 5GinFIRE and IT-Av Testbed Datacenter

# Use Case: Assisted Driving with Video Transcoder

# Experimentation
Experimenters will have access to real OBUs, RSUs, In-Car Node Processors, ESP8266 devices and video cameras, having also the possibility to create and deploy their own VNFs from the 5GinFire portal within the IT-Av automotive testbed. Initially experimenters will have access to a controlled environment in the lab, with the possibility to evaluate and validate their own automotive VNFs services in terms of V2X communication performance and metrics (e.g., latency vs overhead, throughput vs packet loss, etc.), and test their own automotive VNFs within the car with its diversity of contextual-aware information gathered from extra sensors (traffic signals) and from OBUs internal sensors available (accelerometers, heading, speed, link quality connection, GPS, compass, RSSI, car neighbor’s density, etc.). In a later stage experiments will be performed through real experimentations in a controlled and outside environment.

Possible VNFs to be included and tested comprise Li-Fi communication between cars, car crash detection and emergency info dissemination, On-Board Diagnosis for self-repairing, collision avoidance (with machine learning techniques) and others.
